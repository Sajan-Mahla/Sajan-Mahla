so hey everyone, this is sajan from faridkot, punjab. most probably you won't know about it. but lemme take back you to my day 0. so its was just simple day like my summer vacations were going on. i was watching reels
as usual. then out of no-where one voice came into my ear which was saying me congrats. i was like for what, the kid sajan said something in my ear which completely broke me like a hammer on stone, he said "congrats bro
you did it, i said what, so he told me yes you did it you've accomplished all i was dreaming of". to be honest i was completly numb infront of my younger self. so i did give promise to myself then deactiveted everything.
all together. started my iOS dev journey, because the lil sajan was dreaming of to go to apple park. so then i found HACKING WITH SWIFT from paul hudson sir, then journey  started lots of things changed like  thought to learn whole 
week but make an app on sunday which will also going good till day 100. yes this journey  has lots of UP's & DOWN's. like the biggest one was h1b visa thing. yes i was crying. ill sound liar if i said no. but i know 
it will be difficult because if it was easy anybody would do it. now im thanking to day 1 sajan like if he didn't start i wont be here, now i will convert that 100 day to TILL APPLE, now will work hard more and some future 
predicitions. 
the day i made it ill give my first interview at DAILYPOST. 
hope ill make it soon, this for me, and my family.
trust me ive  seen lot of things in this journey. and will see more as this is life.
