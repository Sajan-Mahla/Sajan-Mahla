Hey everyone, Sajan here.
You might be thinking I'm happy writing about this 200-day streak achievement—and professionally, yes, I am. But personally, there are certain things that aren't going well right now. That's just part of life, though, so let's leave it at that.
What matters is that I've maintained this 200-day streak, and I'm genuinely proud of myself for it. Honestly, the last few days have been rough, but sometimes those low points teach us more than any good day or teacher ever could.
Right now, I'm thinking about how to conclude this journey as soon as possible—meaning landing a job at Apple Cupertino before I turn 20 this September.
Here's hoping for the best.
